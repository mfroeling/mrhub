The toolbox does not provide a GUI and its primary goal is to allow for fast and batch data processing, and facilitate development and prototyping of new functions. The core of the toolbox contains various functions for data manipulation and restructuring. The toolbox was developed mostly in the context of quantitative muscle (Froeling et al. 2012), nerve and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The library of functions grows along with the research it is used for and started as a toolbox to analyze DWI data of muscle. Since then it has grown to include many other features such as cardiac analysis (tagging and T1 mapping), dixon reconstruction, EPG modeling and fitting, j-coupling simulations and more. It currently contains over 350 custom functions (over 20.000 lines of code) complete with documentation and demonstrations.",

The visual and modular nature of GPI also allows concise communication of your work with your collaborators and provides an intuitive mechanism for others to start interacting with your research.",

    "longDescription": "The Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) is a free and open-source image- reconstruction framework for Computational Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It consists of a programming library (for C/C++) and a toolbox of command-line programs. The library provides common operations on multi-dimensional arrays, (non-uniform) Fourier and (divergence-free) wavelet transforms, as well as generic implementations of iterative optimization algorithms (CG, IST, FISTA, ADMM, IRGNM, ...) supporting various types of regularization terms (l2, l1-wavelet, total-variation, low-rank, multi-scale low-rank ...) using pre-defined functions. Parallel computation on multi-core systems and on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) is supported. The command-line tools provide direct access to basic operations on multi-dimensional arrays as well as efficient implementations of many calibration and reconstruction algorithms for parallel imaging and compressed sensing (SENSE, ESPIRiT, NLINV, SAKE, ...).",

    "longDescription": "Gadgetron is an Open Source, general-purpose medical imaging reconstruction framework written primarily in C++. It consists of two main components: 1) a set of versatile toolboxes for image signal processing, and 2) a modular, high performance framework for streaming data processing. The streaming framework uses a client server model where the reconstruction job is performed on a server and the client is responsible for sending data and receiving imaging. Clients can be stand-alone command line clients or an imaging device could serve as a client. The framework supports easy prototyping with scripting languages such as Python while supporting transparent integration in clinical work flows. For MRI applications, the Gadgetron supports the vendor independent ISMRM Raw Data format and it comes with high performance image reconstruction pipelines for many standard MRI sequences. Example applications include Cartesian and non-Cartesian parallel imaging, non-linear reconstruction and motion correction. Several performance critical components such as the non-Cartesian Fourier transform have been implemented on GPUs for improved performance. The framework can be used as a complete reconstruction package or the toolboxes can be leveraged in other applications.",

Application Programming Interfaces are available for C/C++, MATLAB, and Python.

The proposed raw data format solves a practical problem for the magnetic resonance imaging community. It may serve as a foundation for reproducible research and collaborations.

The latter can be used to simulate various types of spin motion, e.g. rigid motion, diffusion or flow. JEMRIS is written in C++ and can be used from the command line. The MR experiment configuration is done in XML format and binary I/O utilizes the HDF5 standard. For convenience JEMRIS can also be used via dedicated MATLAB graphical user interfaces. For instance, complex MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and inter-dependent modules can be modeled without any programming involved.",
